# Flipping Out
### Basic Statistical Analysis & Plotting
This project is a recording in Jupyter Notebook of the heads/tails data from tens of thousands of coin toss trials. The large scale data is then analyzed with the help of Python statistics library and matplotlib. Ratios, standard deviation, and means are calculated and presented in scatter plots, line plots, histograms, and box plots.
